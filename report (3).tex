\section{Introduction}
Sentiment analysis is a analysis technique that can determine the opinion of a sentence or a chunk of text. Sentiment analysis is the automatic identification and classification of sentiments expressed in text. Basic sentiment analysis can categorize words into positive, negative, and neutralã€‚In coding, we are doing the rule based sentiment analysis. In computer languages, because of the limitations of logical computation, we usually assign a value to each word, with 0 representing a neutral word, a positive number representing a positive word, and a negative number representing a negative word. Programmers usually use VADER which stands for Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner. in this dictionary, programmers can programmatically call the polarity score, standard deviation, and sentiment scores of each word. intensity scores for each word, which are then used to calculate the scores in a sentence for computerized sentiment analysis.

\section{Explaination}
First we need to store the word score information and so on in the corresponding text file. I will store the score, standard deviation, etc. of the corresponding word in the word struct. I have used the strtok function to separate the information and store it separately. The program then opens the user-supplied file and performs a sentiment analysis on the sentences in it. the underlying logic of the analysis is still to use the strtok function on a line of sentences to split it into individual words and then retrieve them individually in the stored struct. The program adds up the scores and divides them by the total number of words to arrive at a score.
Which is the following:

The book was good.                                                                                       0.47
At least it isn't a horrible book.                                                                       -0.36
The book was only kind of good.                                                                          0.61
The plot was good, but the characters are uncompelling and the dialog is not great.                      0.27
Today SUX!                                                                                               -0.75
Today only kinda sux! But I'll get by, lol                                                               0.16
Make sure you :) or :D today!                                                                            0.80
Not bad at all                                                                                           -0.62

This is the out put of the program with the text file that we provided and the user may change the VADER package and input file, it will also work for same format.
\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the program works with most text files and most VADER packages of the same format to perform a simple sentiment analysis based on the package, which can be used to analyze textual opinions to a certain extent.
